Happy Janmastmi !!
</div>
<p id="wishes"> The heart of the festival: Traditions and emotions
Decor and devotion
Homes and temples are lovingly cleaned, adorned with flowers, lights, rangolis, and swings for “Baal Gopal” (baby Krishna).
The midnight offering
Devotees observe fasts, stay awake, and at the stroke of midnight perform special prayers and abhishekam for the idol, celebrating the moment of Krishna's birth.
Raslila & sacred dramas
Dance and acting bring Krishna’s youth and divine antics to life. Raslila, especially in regions like Mathura and Vrindavan, is one of the most moving expressions of devotion.
Dahi handi festivities
In parts of India, especially Maharashtra, enthusiasts form human pyramids to break a pot filled with curd mirroring Krishna’s playful love for butter.
Fasting and feasting
The day is often observed with a fast, broken only after the midnight puja with delicious prasad, signifying spiritual and communal unity.</p>
